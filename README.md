# File Hosting Web Application

A minimalist file hosting web application built with Java 21 and Spring Boot. Features include file upload/download, zip functionality, storage monitoring, and a clean responsive interface.

## üí° Inspiration

This project was born from a practical problem. A friend asked me: **"How can I transfer files between my iPhone and Android device?"** 

While there are many existing solutions, I thought - why not create a simple, self-hosted web application that works across all devices? This led to the development of this minimalist file hosting service that can be easily deployed anywhere and accessed from any device with a web browser.

**Perfect for:**
- üì± **Cross-platform file sharing** (iPhone ‚Üî Android ‚Üî Desktop)
- üè† **Home networks** where you want to share files between devices
- üîí **Privacy-conscious users** who prefer self-hosted solutions
- üöÄ **Quick deployments** when you need a temporary file sharing solution

## Features

- üìÅ **File Upload & Download**: Support for images, videos, documents, and archives (up to 20GB per file)
- üóúÔ∏è **Zip Functionality**: Download individual files or create zip archives of selected files
- üìä **Storage Monitoring**: Real-time storage usage visualization with configurable limits
- üîç **File Management**: Search, filter, and organize uploaded files
- üì± **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on iPhone, Android, and desktop devices
- üöÄ **Easy Deployment**: Single JAR file deployment suitable for cloud platforms
- üåê **Cross-Platform**: Access from any device with a web browser

## Technology Stack

- **Java 21** (LTS)
- **Spring Boot 3.2.0**
- **Spring Data JPA** with H2 database
- **Thymeleaf** for templating
- **Bootstrap 5** for UI
- **Maven** for build management

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Java 21 or higher
- Maven 3.6+ (optional - can use included wrapper)

### Local Development

1. **Clone and navigate to the project:**
   ```bash
   cd file_hosting
   ```

2. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   # Using Maven wrapper (recommended)
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   
   # Or using Maven directly
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

3. **Access the application:**
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`
   - The application will create an `uploads` folder automatically
   - Database files will be created in the `data` folder

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build the JAR file
./mvnw clean package

# The executable JAR will be in target/
java -jar target/file-hosting-app-1.0.0.jar
```

## Large File Support

This application supports files up to **20GB** in size, making it perfect for sharing large video files between devices:

### üìπ **Optimized for Video Sharing**
- Support for large video files (4K recordings, long videos, etc.)
- Efficient streaming for file downloads
- Progress indicators for large uploads
- Automatic cleanup of temporary files

### ‚ö° **Performance Considerations**
- Files larger than 10MB are written to disk during upload (not kept in memory)
- Configurable connection timeouts for large file transfers
- Efficient file streaming for downloads
- Background processing for zip creation

### üîß **System Requirements for Large Files**
- **RAM**: Minimum 2GB recommended, **8GB optimal for 20GB file support**
- **Disk Space**: Ensure sufficient space for uploads + temporary files
- **Network**: Stable connection for large file transfers
- **Java Heap**: **6GB recommended for 8GB RAM servers** (`-Xmx6g`)

## üñ•Ô∏è **Production Server Optimization (8GB RAM, 2 Core, 160GB NVMe)**

For your specific server configuration, the app is optimized with:
- **Memory Allocation**: 6GB JVM heap (75% of 8GB RAM)
- **Thread Pool**: 50 max threads (25 per CPU core)
- **Storage**: 120GB for uploads (75% of 160GB NVMe)
- **Temp Files**: 50MB threshold for NVMe SSD optimization

### Quick Production Deployment
```bash
chmod +x deploy-production.sh
./deploy-production.sh
```

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Thymeleaf Template Parsing Error**
   - **Error**: `Only variable expressions returning numbers or booleans are allowed in this context`
   - **Solution**: This error occurs when using string expressions in event handlers. The fix has been implemented using data attributes instead of inline onclick handlers.

2. **Out of Memory**: Increase JVM heap size with `-Xmx512m` or higher
3. **Permission Denied**: Ensure upload directory has proper permissions
4. **File Size Limit**: Check both Spring Boot and web server limits
5. **Database Lock**: Stop application properly to avoid database locks

### Template Security

Starting with Thymeleaf 3.1, security restrictions prevent string expressions in event handlers like `onclick`. The application now uses:
- Data attributes (`data-file-id`, `data-file-name`) to pass values
- JavaScript event delegation to handle clicks securely
- This approach is more secure and follows modern web development practices

### Performance Tuning

- Adjust JVM memory settings based on usage (recommended: `-Xmx2g` for large files)
- Configure appropriate file size limits
- Consider using external storage for large deployments
- Monitor disk space regularly

### Large File Upload Issues

1. **Upload Timeout**: Increase `server.connection-timeout` in application.yml
2. **Memory Issues**: Files >10MB are automatically written to disk, not kept in memory
3. **Disk Space**: Ensure sufficient space for uploads + temporary files during processing
4. **Network Stability**: Large file uploads require stable internet connection
